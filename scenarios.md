### Test User Quality Experience (based on the audience)
* **Accessibility** - Suggestion - users might have sight issue without wearing glass based on their age range. So, the zoom-in feature can help improving the quality of the section.
* **Usability** - Positive point - Most of the users of this section can have professional careers. So, they are busy. The section should give them as much information as possible in the least amount of time. 
* **Color** - Positive point - Using the proper color of green and red helps the users to find their goals as soon as posible.
* **Proportion** (the relative size and scale of various elements in a design) - Suggestion - Accordin to the rule of thirds, the most important part of the section does'nt have an important message in the computer screen.
